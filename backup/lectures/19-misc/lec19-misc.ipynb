    "\n",
    "* Your \"Chisel\" design is a valid Scala program (otherwise will get a Scala compile error)\n",
    "  * Chisel is a Scala library, and we treat it like an _embedded domain-specific language_\n",
    "* While executing, any Chisel object referenced/constructed is instantiated\n",
    "  * Includes even a literal (e.g. `4.U`) or a slight tweak (e.g. `~io.in`)\n",
    "  * Every object has _inputs_ and/or _outputs_\n",
    "  * Under the hood, those objects are tracked (e.g. inside `extends Module`)\n",
    "* Chisel connections (`:=` and `<>`) induce side-effects on the Chisel objects\n",
    "  * Changes inputs by connecting them to outputs\n",
    "* _Summary:_ think of your Chisel design as a Scala program that _instantiates_ Chisel things and _connects_ them\n",
    "  * Much of the parameterizability/flexibility is coming from the Scala program\n",
    "* Your goal is to properly connect things to the inputs/outputs of modules\n",
    "  * Tools will prune components that are uncreachable from an input or output"

    "  * Even though we are only simulating and not manufacturing the physical designs, the design is unchanged\n",
    "  * A mux input can change its output, but it has static connections externally\n",
    "* A wire can carry different values in different cycles (in simulation or real world), but the wire's endpoint connections are unchanged\n",
    "  * A wire has no internal state, and directly propagates its input to its output\n",
    "  * A wire changing value over \"time\" is caused by its input changing over time\n",
    "* A _register_ (or memory) has internal state, but only changes value at the rising clock edge\n",
    "  * At rising edge, input value becomes output (and internal state) value\n",
    "  * Typically in Chisel we don't explicitly show clock, so sometimes easy to loose track of when things change"
